// Keep them separate so that they are used by variants and as defaults.
// They are alias tokens so they can be imported here rather than on the theme,
// when used to customise a component instance theyâ€™ll substitute in the theme
// scale tokens.
// @TODO Need a way to generate these from the theme though, they won't
// change as the theme changes -> moot, they don't directly reference the theme,
// just parts of it. Static or by reference?
