* export basic icons for use with the base library
* expose a way to extend the icons, e.g. checkbox uses the check icon, how to extend that?
* can we expose multiple props on some icons for things like multi-colour or transitions?

import { Settings, Home } from 'react-basic-icons'

<div>
  <Settings size={4} />
  <Home color='red.400' color2='red.600' />
</div>
